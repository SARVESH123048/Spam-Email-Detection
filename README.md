# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based solution for detecting spam emails. The model is trained to classify emails as either **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using natural language processing and classification algorithms.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Spam emails are a major issue in communication systems. This project applies machine learning to filter out spam emails based on their content. It includes preprocessing of the data, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training a classification model to accurately detect spam messages.
